   - Supports multiple languages
   - Handles temporary file management

2. **GUI Components**
   - Modern PyQt-based interface
   - Custom UI components with glass effects
   - Real-time status updates
   - Tabbed interface for different functionalities

3. **Advanced Anomaly Detection System**
   - Real-time audio anomaly detection using Isolation Forest algorithm
   - Text content analysis for offensive language
   - Multi-language support (English and Arabic)
   - Continuous learning from audio patterns
   - Statistical feature extraction for audio analysis
   - Customizable contamination thresholds
   - Automatic model initialization and updates

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://git@github.com:Eng-Nhshl/tts-stt-studio.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application for the console interface:
```bash
